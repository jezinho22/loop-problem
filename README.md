# loop-problem

Here is a puzzler for you. I came across an issue when making a guessing game which used a loop. I wanted to write each guess to the html, but js doesn't seem to work that way. So far I have read about asynchronous, setTimeOut and setInterval but the only solution so far is to not use a loop. That doesn't make sense - there must a be a way to do this from a loop. Have a look at this example and watch what happens.  
I am also wondering how this works with writing wait-for-user functions in games, and background animation loops in games (eg having something moving independently while user moves a sprite)
